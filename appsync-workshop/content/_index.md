## Migrate an existing applications RESTful API's to GraphQL using AWS Amplify and AWS AppSync

### Welcome!

<p style='text-align: left;'>
    In this workshop we will take an existing stock trading application written in React and AWS Amplify.  We will convert its API from using REST ( Amazon API-Gateway )to using GraphQL ( AWS AppSync ).
    
    In doing so we will also realise and explore the benefits that GraphQL API's have over traditional RESTful API's
